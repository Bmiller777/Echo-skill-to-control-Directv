# Echo-skill-to-control-Directv
This is an attempt to create a amazon echo skill that will control a networked Directv Receiver so that users can control Directv with their voice

This is a hack job on another GitHub Repository: https://github.com/MrEggsalad/Echo-Roku-Voice-Control

as of this date, I am having trouble with the AWS Lambda Files "Alexa Skill" and "Index".  I have put both of these files into a .zip and uploaded to aws lambda, but I can not get AWS to POST my urls.

If anyone has a solution to make this work, it would be greatly appreciated!
